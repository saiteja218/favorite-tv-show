            <!-- <h4>synopsis</h4> -->
            <p><strong>Synopsis: </strong> "Rick and Morty" is an animated sci-fi comedy series created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon. The show follows the misadventures of an eccentric and alcoholic scientist, Rick Sanchez, and his kind-hearted but easily influenced grandson, Morty Smith, as they travel through dimensions and galaxies, encountering bizarre creatures, parallel universes, and mind-bending phenomena. While Rick is a brilliant but morally ambiguous inventor with a disdain for authority, Morty is an ordinary teenager thrust into increasingly surreal and dangerous situations by his grandfather's reckless behavior. Together, they embark on wild escapades that often lead to chaos, destruction, and existential crises, all while exploring themes of family, friendship, and the nature of reality. With its blend of humor, wit, and imaginative storytelling, "Rick and Morty" has garnered a devoted fanbase and critical acclaim for its unique take on science fiction and social commentary.</p>
